For MSSM monojet with p p > n1 n1 j process. 

	No difference in THT, MHT, TET and MET --> Only use MET (Missing Transverse Energy)
	No difference in sqrt(s) and M(n1 n1 p) --> Only use sqrt(s)

	Should the independent transverse momentum for each particle be used, different if p p > z j and p p > n1 n1 j as there are more histograms in p p > n1 n1 j?

	Is ETA distribution interesting, difference between ETA for z (process p p > z j, SM model) and n1 (process p p > n1 n1 j, MSSM model).

	Mass Change:
         Cross Section vary, maybe store it as a feature if the mass difference makes it change?
	 The sqrt(s) vary. Moving on x-axis and more concentrated distribution in higher mass. Where to make the cut, for lower mass --> Noise in tail but necessary info in higher mass histogram at higher GeV.         Slope steeper in lower mass in MET
	 Wider ETA distribution for lower mass --> lower peak

Difference between all of the models:
	Cross-Section different for all models with same mass of DM candidate. Mass[chi_1, sv1] = 700, 700. No special mass for SM model. 
	MET cut of short for SM. Not much difference between (p p > sve sve~ j) and (p p > n1 n1 j), just a little slope difference (implicit diff mean value)
	sqrt(s) small for SM. Higher peak for (p p > n1 n1 j) than (p p > sve sve~ j)
	No difference in ETA distribution for n1 and sve but the z in SM model is a trivial difference. 
	Wider DELTAR for n1 n1 than sve sve~

Answer from Harrys mail: 

	Cross section vary between every model with different parameters and the amount of free parameters. In others model you could change the coupling parameters which will result in a
	change of the cross section. And in this project we will focus more on the shapes of the histograms so we do not want to include the cross section. 
		--> Do not include cross section

	In mono-jet. All of our visible momentum is hadronic and the missing momentum is attributed to dark matter particles. Initial state have zero transverse momentum and due to 
	the conservation of momentum, the hadronic and missing transverse momenta must be equal. Therefore --> THT, MHT, TET, MET looks quite the same. 
		--> Include MET
		--> Do not include THT, MHT, TET

	We cannot measure SQRTS experimentally as some of our particles are invisible. One has to reconstruct all momentum compenets of all the particles involved to determine SQRTS. 
		Can do with ma5 -R (reconstructed mode) ???, if we can then can include it. Otherwise not. 
		--> Maybe include SQRTS, depend on the above row. 

	ETA distribution comes mainly from parton distribution functions, which are different for quark and gluon initiated processes. 
		--> Will help, include ETA.

	In mono-jet we don't expect that neutralino/sneutrino would differ in terms of PT as the emitted gluons/quarks comes from the initial state, and not from the DM particles. Which
	means that there should be no spin dependence. Expect it to be different for the mono-Z event. 
		--> Include PT for the DM particles as it would be different for mono-Z. 

	Will not be able to measure the DELTAR for invisible particles. 
		--> Do not include DELTAR.

	For the luminosity we can have the same as before, 10 fb^-1 since it does not change the shape of the distributions.
