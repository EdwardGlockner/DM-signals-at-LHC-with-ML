# DM-signals-at-LHC-with-ML

## Description
This is project by Edward Glöckner, Max Andersson and Carl Löfkvist. It was supervised by Stefano Moretti, Prashant Singh, Rikard Enberg, Harri Waltari at Uppsala University. The project investigates the role deep learning can have in the discovery of new physics.

The search for evidence of a dark matter particle is one of the hottest topics is physics today. As high energy physics experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN is yet to produce fruitful results in this pursuit, some have resorted to monte carlo simulation tools to gain further knowledge in the area. In such programs, high energy physics can be conducted on new models and paradigms using sophisticated and sound tools. In this project, the production of so a called dark matter candidate particle from high energy proton-proton collisions are investigated using such tools. The tool of choice for this project is *[MadGraph](https://nloaccess.in2p3.fr/tools/MG5/index)*

## Aim
The *aim* of the project is to develop a deep learning model that can, to a satisfactory degree of accuracy, determine whether a proton-proton collision resulted in the production of a dark matter candidate particle. If true, the model outputs a prediction of the mass of the dark matter candidate particle.
