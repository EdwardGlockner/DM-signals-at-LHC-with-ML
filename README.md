## About the Project
This is a project by Edward Glöckner, Max Andersson and Carl Löfkvist. It was supervised by Stefano Moretti, Prashant Singh, Rikard Enberg, Harri Waltari at Uppsala University. The project investigates the role deep learning can have in the discovery of new physics.

The project can be divided into two sub-projects, where the first is simulating proton-proton collisions generating data, and the second is analyzing the data using deep learning techniques.

## Introduction
The search for evidence of a dark matter particle is one of the hottest topics is physics today. As high energy physics experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is yet to produce fruitful results in this pursuit, some have resorted to Monte Carlo simulation tools to gain further knowledge in the area. In such programs, high energy physics can be conducted on new models and paradigms that extends the standard model using sophisticated and sound tools. In this project, the production of so a called dark matter candidate particle from high energy proton-proton collisions are investigated using such tools. The tool of choice for this project is *[MadGraph](https://nloaccess.in2p3.fr/tools/MG5/index)*

The complementary program *[MadAnalysis](https://launchpad.net/madanalysis5)* enables the generation of histograms of relevant quantities from the files generated by *MadGraph*. These histograms constitutes the training data for the deep learning model.

### Goals
The *goal* of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can, to a satisfactory degree of accuracy, determine whether a proton-proton collision resulted in the production of a dark matter candidate particle. If true, the model outputs a prediction of the mass of the dark matter candidate particle. Both the classification and mass regression models are realized using a Convolutional Neural Newtwork (CNN) and a Bayesian CNN

### Event Generation
In context of the LHC, an *event* is the collision of two particles at high energy, and the aftermath that follows. MadGraph enables the generation and manipulation of events, calculation of *[cross sections]*(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(physics)) and sophisticated analyzing of event files with MadAnalysis. Using these programs, histograms of quantities such as Missing Transverse Energy (MET), Transverse Momentum (PT), [Pseudorapidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorapidity) ($\eta$) can be obtained. From these a deep learning model can be trained.


### Deep Learning
<!--- What is Deep Learning compared to regualar machine learning -->
<!--- What is the model(s) trying to predict? Mass and type of model -->
<!--- Architecture? CNN (mention general structure of layers), and bCNN
<!--- Possible tell what accuracy the model obtained? -->

<!-- Run Locally -->
## Run Locally

Start by cloning the repository

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/EdwardGlockner/DM-signals-at-LHC-with-ML.git
```

Below are tutorials for both the data generation part in MadGraph, and also the deep learning part in Python.

### Data generation

### Deep learning

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install the necessary libraries by running the `install.py`. The python version for which the libraries will be installed for can be modified through the -v flag, which is set to none by default.

```bash
  python install.py -v <python-version>
```

and navigate to one of the assignment folders. Open the folder in MATLAB. Drag the helper functions to the same directory as the .mlx file and run the live script. If you don't have the ability to run MATLAB, you can see the .pdf-files.
