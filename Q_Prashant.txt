1. Explain the thought behind choosing the amount of convolutional layers, pooling layers and dense layers in a CNN
2. Some researchers using MNIST didnt use any pooling layers, why?
3. Thoughts on our model architecture (show drawing)
4. The images from the event generation are quite big: 646x425?. Is this a problem? Should we resize them?
5. What do you think about data augmentation for our task? Considering using scaling/resizing, and translation
6. Ensamble of CNN:s? Is it overkill?
7. What is a good kernel size in our convolutional layer in our case?
8. Should we use batch normalization after every convolutional layer to standardize the input?
9. Thoughts on adding extra numerical features after the convolutional layers, to merge them via a fully connected layers?
10. Thoughts on using multiple images as input to our CNN? Three separate CNN:s and merge them via a fully connected layer?
11. Should we run more events on the same mass as it is a stochastic process which makes the model less generalized?
12. How many masses should we use and the spacing between them?
