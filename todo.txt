TODOS:
    1. Modify the parton_cards to plot the correct histograms (see notes.txt)
    2. When those work, make sure that uppmax_run.sh saves the correct histogram
        arrays to the correct output folders and csv files
    3. Check so everything works correctly, by submitting test jobs
    4. Write a new data_prep_1D_z.py, and look over data_prep_1D_jet, so they
        work for the new changes
    5. Generate new param_cards.dat for neutralino and sneutrino
    6. Should now be 2000 events per histogram
    (7. Calle (never trust him) has tried to remove all traces of 'neutrino', now 'sneutrino')
    7. Dubbelcheck uppmax_parallel.py so it works with our new changes.


GOAL FOR THE WEEK:
    1. Done with event generation
    2. Begun training our models (experimenting locally, maybe try uppmax)
    3. Write on our report
