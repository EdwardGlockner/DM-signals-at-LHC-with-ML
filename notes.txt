RIGHT NOW WE TAKE:
    MET: selection_1.py 
    ETA: selection_4,6,8.py
    TET: selection_0.py (THT: total hadronic thrust) 
    (PT: selection_3,5,7.py) 

create one classifier for monoz and one for monojet
create on regression for monoz and one for monojet

pick leading lepton, better to use both leptons since we are separating 
monoz and monojet entirely



In monoz case there are 3 ETA images: z, l-, l+. Which is interesting?
In monojet case there are 3 ETA images: p, n1, n2

TET and missing transverse are interchangable in our case

We tested running two jobs in parallel, each generating 2 (*3) histograms each. 
Total used [h]: 0.6. Which means each job took 0.3. Which mean each image took
0.15. 

In total 4 classes, and we want 10 000 histograms per class. In total 40000 histos.

40 000 * 0.15 = 6000 h. We are limited to 2000 h
