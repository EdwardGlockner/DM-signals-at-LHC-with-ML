Hard (partonic) matrix element: MadGraph5
Website: https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo
Manual: arXiv 1405.0301, in-built tutorial, summer school notes by Olivier Mattelaer
(e.g. https://indico.cern.ch/event/239005/attachments/402547/559634/13_02_16_tutomg.pdf)
Prerequisites: modern Fortran and C++ compilers, Python3

Parton showering/fragmentation: Pythia8 (can be used for matrix element generation, too)
Website: https://pythia.org/, can be installed as a MadGraph plugin or standalone version
Manual: arXiv 2203.11601 or https://pythia.org//latest-manual/Welcome.html, standalone version has several example codes

Detector simulation: Delphes3
Website: https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/delphes, can be installed also as a MadGraph plugin
Manual: arXiv 1307.6346, cards for various detector configurations are around the internet

Cut-based analysis: MadAnalysis5 (also possible to recast some existing analyses)
Website: https://launchpad.net/madanalysis5
Manual: arXiv 1206.1599

Other stuff
Root, web page https://root.cern/, needs to be installed for Delphes to function properly
LHAPDF6, also a MadGraph plugin, web page https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/, list of available PDF sets https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/pdfsets.html

List of things that need to be installed for MG5:
zlib, boost, hepmc, collier, lhapdf6, pythia8, mg5_py8_interface, ExRootAnalysis (install root before this), Delphes
the other ones are needed if loop computations need to be done, MadAnalysis5 might be preferable as a standalone version, 
maddm is a dark matter code (relic density & direct detection cross sections), but runs only on python2


Model files:
SARAH webpages https://sarah.hepforge.org/trac/wiki
FeynRules webpages https://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be/wiki/ModelDatabaseMainPage

(I have the capability of implementing models with SARAH, Luca with FeynRules, but implementing a model from scratch takes time...)

Example commands:

Launching MG5:
./bin/mg5_aMC

Generating a monojet process:
import model MSSM
generate p p > n1 n1 j
output MSSMmonojet
launch

Running MA5 as a script:
./bin/ma5 -s --recolevel name_of_your_code (--partonlevel for lhe, --hadronlevel for hepmc, --recolevel for lhco)
